Episode 7: Managing Context and Memory in Chainlit

Learning Objectives:
1) Understand why globals don't work for per-user state.
2) Use cl.user_session to store/retrieve data across messages in a chat.
3) Implement simple memory: remember user's name and previous questions.

How to run:
1) pip install chainlit
2) chainlit run 01-Core_Concepts/07-Context_and_Memory/07-context_and_memory.py -w
3) Open http://localhost:8000 and try:
   - "My name is Alice"
   - "What's my name?"
   - Ask a few questions ending with ? then "What was my last question?"
   - Observe the per-session message number in each reply.

Notes:
- cl.user_session stores data PER CHAT SESSION (tab/conversation), not globally.
- The small global counter below is for demo only to show why globals are shared.
